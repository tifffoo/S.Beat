<h2>You may have...</h2>
<h1>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/AIDS</h1>
<p title=HIV>
<p>A sexually transmitted virus spread through certain body fluids (blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk), HIV destroys many of the body's CD4 cells (aka T cells) if left untreated. These cells are essential in helping the body fight off infection and disease, and the damage seriously weakens the immune system.</p>

<h4>Ways to prevent HIV:</h4>
<p title=Prevention>
<p>Practicing safe sex and practices on a college campus is extremely important. Because there is no vaccine to prevent HIV and no cure for AIDS, take action before you or others get an infection.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use a new condom every time you have sex. Stick to water-based lubricant (if you use it) rather than oil-based to prevent weakening/breaking of the condom. For oral sex, try using a dental dam.</li>
    <li>Make sure to communicate with your sexual partner(s) if you or they have HIV.</li>
    <li>If you use needles to inject drugs, make sure your needle is sterile and you keep it to yourself.</li>

<h1 style="color:white;">Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/AIDS</h1>
	<p title=HIV>
</center>
	<p style="color:white;">A sexually transmitted virus spread through certain body fluids (blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk), HIV destroys many of the body's CD4 cells (aka T cells) if left untreated. These cells are essential in helping the body fight off infection and disease, and the damage seriously weakens the immune system.</p>

<h4 style="color:white;">Ways to prevent HIV:</h4>
	<p title=Prevention>
			<p style="color:white">Practicing safe sex and practices on a college campus is extremely important. Because there is no vaccine to prevent HIV and no cure for AIDS, take action before you or others get an infection.</p>

<ul style="color:white;">
	<li>Use a new condom every time you have sex. Stick to water-based lubricant (if you use it) rather than oil-based to prevent weakening/breaking of the condom. For oral sex, try using a dental dam.</li>
    <li>Make sure to communicate with your sexual partner(s) if you or they have HIV.</li>
    <li>If you use needles to inject drugs, make sure your needle is sterile and you keep it to yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color:white;">Symptoms include:</h4>
<p title=Symptoms>

    <li>soaking night sweats</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color:white;">Treatments include:</h4>
	<p title=Treatments>
		<p style="color:white;">HIV currently has no cure, but Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is reccommended for every who has HIV.</p>

<h4 style="color:white;">What is ART?</h4>

<p title=Symptoms>

<ul>
	<li>genital warts</li>
    <li>warts in the throat</li>
    <li>small bumps</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these warts may go away on their own, the virus still lives within the infected person's body.</p>

<h4>Seeing a Doctor:</h4>
<p title=Seeing a Doctor>

<p>Because HPV sometimes does not go away on its own, serious health problems can arise from the virus. For women, it is recommended to have their first Pap smear (a test to so identify abnormal cells in women) at age 21. From ages 21 to 20, these tests should happen every 3 three years. If 1 of the 13 strains of HPV that lead to cancer are found in a test, your doctor may begin seeing you more often to monitor for cervical changes and perform more frequent Pap tests.</p>

<p>In most cases, HPV goes away on its own. There is no treatment made for HPV, but your doctor will most likely ask you to come in over a prolonged period of time to check on your infection. Keep in contact with your physician.</p>

<p>Mono does not have a therapy or antibiotic tailored to work against it. Treatment mostly stems from taking care of yourself with the following steps.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Drink water and fruit juice. Lots of fluids help ease the fever and sore throat.</li>
    <li>Gargle with salt water (1/2 teaspoon of salt in 8oz of warm water).</li>
    <li>Over the counter medicine such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) can relieve symptoms. Use them as needed.</li>
    <li>Step away from sports or intense physical activity. Symptoms of mono lessen over a couple of weeks, but it's likely you won't feel like yourself for a few months. To make the recovery process as fast as possible, try to rest as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
